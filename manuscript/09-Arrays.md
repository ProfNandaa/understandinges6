### Array.of()

JavaScript has long had a quirk around creating arrays. The `Array` constructor behaves differently based on the type of data passed into it. For example:

```js
let items = new Array(1, 2);        // length is 2
console.log(items.length);          // 2
console.log(items[0]);              // 1
console.log(items[1]);              // 2

items = new Array(2);
console.log(items.length);          // 2
console.log(items[0]);              // undefined
console.log(items[1]);              // undefined

items = new Array("2");
console.log(items.length);          // 1
console.log(items[0]);              // "2"
```

When the `Array` constructor is passed a single numeric value, that value is set to be the `length` of the array; if a single non-numeric value is passed, then that value becomes the one and only item in the array; if multiple values are passed (numeric or not), then those values become items in the array. This behavior is both confusing and risky, as you may not always be aware of the type of data being passed.

ECMAScript 6 introduces `Array.of()` to solve this problem. `Array.of()` works in a manner that is similar to the `Array` constructor. The only difference is the removal of the special case regarding a single numeric value. The `Array.of()` method always creates an array containing its arguments regardless of the number of arguments or the argument types. Here are some examples:

```js
let items = Array.of(1, 2);         // length is 2
console.log(items.length);          // 2
console.log(items[0]);              // 1
console.log(items[1]);              // 2

items = Array.of(2);
console.log(items.length);          // 1
console.log(items[0]);              // 2

items = Array.of("2");
console.log(items.length);          // 1
console.log(items[0]);              // "2"
```

The `Array.of()` method is similar to using an array literal, which is to say, you can use an array literal instead of `Array.of()` for native arrays most of the time. If you ever need to pass the `Array` constructor into a function, then you might want to pass `Array.of()` instead to get consistent behavior. For example:

```js
function createArray(arrayConstructor, value) {
    return arrayConstructor(value);
}

let items = createArray(Array.of, value);
```

This is a somewhat contrived example, but when dealing with derived array classes or typed arrays, you may find this pattern to be quite useful.

### Array.from()

One of the more cumbersome tasks in JavaScript has long been converting array-like objects into actual arrays. For instance, if you have an `arguments` object (which is array-like) and want to work with it as if it's an array, then you'd need to convert it first. Traditionally,  you'd write a function such as:

```js
function makeArray(arrayLike) {
    var result = [];

    for (var i = 0, len = arrayLike.length; i < len; i++) {
        result.push(arrayLike[i]);
    }

    return result;
}

function doSomething() {
    var args = makeArray(arguments);

    // use args
}
```

However, developers soon discovered that you could shorten the amount of code by using the native array `slice()` method:

```js
function makeArray(arrayLike) {
    return Array.prototype.slice.call(arrayLike);
}

function doSomething() {
    var args = makeArray(arguments);

    // use args
}
```

Even though this required less typing, it's not at all obvious that `Array.prototype.slice.call()` means "convert to an array." This works because you're setting the `this` value for `slice()` to the array-like object. Since `slice()` needs only numeric indices and a `length` property to function correctly, any array-like object will work.

The `Array.from()` method was added in ECMAScript 6 as a more obvious way of converting array-like objects into arrays. Simple usage is as follows:

```js
function doSomething() {
    var args = Array.from(arguments);

    // use args
}
```

The `Array.from()` call in this example creates a new array based on the items in `arguments`. So `args` is an instance of `Array` that contains the same values in the same positions as `arguments`.

If you want to take this conversion a step further, you can provide a second argument to `Array.from()` that is a mapping function used to convert each value into a final form. For example:

```js
function translate() {
    return Array.from(arguments, (value) => value + 1);
}

let numbers = translate(1, 2, 3);

console.log(numbers);               // 2,3,4
```

Here, `Array.from()` is used with a mapping function that adds one to each item in the array. If the mapping function is on an object, you can optionally pass a third argument to `Array.from()` that represents the `this` value for the mapping function, such as:

```js
let helper = {
    diff: 1,

    add(value) {
        return value + this.diff;
    }
};

function translate() {
    return Array.from(arguments, helper.add, helper);
}

let numbers = translate(1, 2, 3);

console.log(numbers);               // 2,3,4
```

This example uses the `helper.add()` method as the mapping function for the conversion. Since `helper.add()` uses `this.diff`, you need to provide the third argument to `Array.from()` specifying the value of `this`. In this way, `Array.from()` can easily handle conversion of data without needing to use `bind()` or another way of specifying the `this` value.

The `Array.from()` method works on both array-like objects and iterables. That means any object with an `@@iterator` property can be converted into an array using `Array.from()`. For example:

```js
let collection = {
    items: [],
    *[Symbol.iterator]() {
        yield *this.items.values();
    }

};

collection.items.push(1);
collection.items.push(2);
collection.items.push(3);

let numbers = Array.from(collection, (value) => value + 1);

console.log(numbers);               // 2,3,4
```

In this code, the `collection` object is an iterable so it can be passed directly to `Array.from()` to convert its values into an array.

I> If an object is both array-like and iterable, then the iterator is used by `Array.from()` to determine the values to convert.
